# Questionnaire Game

## Introduction

As a school assignment we have to create 'something' with some more advanced Javascript stuff.
I'm going to create a fairly simple questionnaire game where a player chooses a category and difficulty, gets a corresponding question along with four possible answers. 
For this project I will be using [Angular](https://angularjs.org/), supported by tests written with [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/).
